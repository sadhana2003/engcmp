<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

         <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>I grew up in Pittsburgh, so I've lived here mostly all my life. I have one older brother and, unfortunately, 0 pets. I've always wanted a dog, but my parents never agreed to it. I took this class because I have some background with tech and was curious how tech can tie into writing. Some of my hobbies include dance, I did Indian Classical Dance for about 10 years, and I also really love to travel. I was on a cruise to the Bahamas last month, but my favorite vacation spot so far is probably Dubai. I attached a few of my favorite vacation pictures! </h2>

Althought I've done a few projects using HTML/CSS, I never really got much experience with it, so I'm hoping I'll learn and get more exposure to UI/UX and how important and necessary it will be for different projects and presentations I will need to do in the future.
